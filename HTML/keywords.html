        <p1>CLASS:</p1>
        <h1 style="font-size:20px;">In Java, the class keyword is used to define a new class, which acts as a blueprint for creating objects. A class can contain variables, methods, and constructors that define its behavior and state. It's the foundation of object-oriented programming in Java.

<h1>_______________________________________________________________________________</h1>
<p1>PUBLIC </p1>
<h2 style="font-size:20px;">The public keyword is an access modifier that allows the associated class, method, or variable to be accessed from anywhere in the program. It's commonly used for methods that need to be called from other classes. Using public ensures maximum visibility across packages.
</h2>
<h2>________________________________________________________________________________</h2>
<p1>STATIC</p1>
<h3 style="font-size:20px;">When a member is declared static, it belongs to the class rather than any specific instance of the class. This means it can be accessed without creating an object. Static members are shared among all instances and are useful for constants and utility methods.
