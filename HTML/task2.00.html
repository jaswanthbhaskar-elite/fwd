    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Can't Hurt Me</h1>
    <h3>Author: <i>David Goggins</i></h3>
     <h4>Core Message:</h4>
     <p style="color:red">Most people only tap into about 40% of their potential. By embracing discomfort, discipline, and resilience, you can unlock the rest.
</p>
<h4>Structure: 
</h4><p>
    Each chapter shares Goggins’ personal story <span style="color:red;">(from childhood trauma to Navy SEAL 
    training and ultra-endurance feats)</span> and ends with a “challenge” for readers to app
    ly in their own lives.
</p>
<h3>🌟 Strengths:</h3>
<p>
    - <b>Authenticity: </b> Goggins doesn’t sugarcoat his past—poverty, abuse, racism, and obesity. His vulnerability makes the transformation more inspiring.
<br>- <b>Actionable Lessons:</b> The “challenges” at the end of each chapter encourage readers to do the work, not just read passively.
<br>- <b>Motivational Impact: </b>Many readers report feeling energized to push past excuses and embrace discomfort.
<br>- <b>Unique Perspective: </b>Few authors combine military toughness, athletic endurance, and personal struggle in such a direct, no-nonsense way.
